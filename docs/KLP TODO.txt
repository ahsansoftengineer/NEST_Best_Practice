Warning 
1. first of all we have to make 
    const task: Task = {
      ...data,
      lawyerId //
    };
2. then we have to pass the lawyer object it self
3. otherwise we have to use queryBuilder to create, update

same is the case for this
    return this.repos.lawyerClient.findBy({lawyer: {id}})
